&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou will not be able to stay home, brother.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbs&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppYou will not be able to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspplug in, turn on and cop out.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSkip out for beer during commercials,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBecause the&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp revolution will not be televised.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe revolution will not be televised.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn 4 parts without&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp commercial interruptions.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlowing a bugle and leading a charge by John
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMitchell, General &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAbrams and Spiro Agnew to eat
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe revolution will not be televised.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe revolution will&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp not be brought to you by the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSchaefer Award Theatre and will not star Natalie
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWoods and Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The revolution will &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnot give your mouth sex appeal.
The revolution will not get rid of the nubs.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe revolution will not make you look five pounds
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThinner, because the revolution will not be televised, Brother.
