<p><h1>You will not be able to stay home, brother.
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out.
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and
Skip out for beer during commercials,
Because the revolution will not be televised.</p></h1>

<em>The revolution swill not be televised.
The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox
In <strong>4 parts without commercial interruptions.</strong>
The revolution will <strong>not show you pictures of Nixon</strong>
Blowing a bugle and<strong>leading a charge by John</strong>
Mitchell, General<strong>Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat</strong>
Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary.</em></p>

Woods and Steve McQueen or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>Bullwinkle and Julia.</h4>

The revolution will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h6>not get rid of the nubs.</h6>
The revolution will not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h6>make you look five pounds</h6>
<strong>Thinner, because the revolution will not be televised, Brother.</strong></p>
